I thought it was about time that I started a blog on my progress with this game so far. It's only Alpha 2 (which will be released soon!) but it's continuing to grow on me.

What started out as a mini hobby project to keep my coding skills up has turned into one of my largest personal development projects. I figured I would stop after I'd tried some techniques and got something basic up and running, but between writing a relatively self-contained game engine and the actual content of the game, it's turning out to be quite interesting.

Alpha 1 was really more of a proof-of-concept, but represents a playable (albeit very limited) game. You can win, you can lose, you can fight Orcs and move across levels. If that's enough Roguelike for you, enjoy! For anyone who is looking for more in their games (though perhaps not graphics-wise), I think you'll like what's in store. See a future post on what's coming up in Alpha 2, as well as development updates on features as they're developed.

P.S. Oh and the site is served up in Jekyll, will add formatting soon!
