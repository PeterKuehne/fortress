Alpha 4:
    WindowManager upgrade:
        ✔ Windows should be created templatized:
            ✔ WindowManager has create<T>(args, retval) function
            ✔ create<T>() function calls initialise
            ✔ Add setup() function
            ✔ Change pushWindow function
            ✔ Remove WindowManagerInterface
        Window Enhancements:
            ☐ Remove getEngine() from Windows
            ✔ Differentiate drawChar() from drawTile()
                The first uses the Fontset, the second the GraphicsSet
            ☐ Move graphicsBegin/End out of WindowManager engine
            ✔ Add full-screen setting
                Removes the need for getEngine() to retrieve the size of the screen

    Make NPCs smarter:
        ✔ Better FSM for NPCs
    ✔ Quests:
        ✔ Add basic quest
        ✔ Add kill quest
        ✔ Make quest complete/fail
        ✔ QuestWindow
    ✔ Better rendering code:
        ✔ Camera:
            ✔ Window Width + Height
            ✔ Map Offset x, y
            ✔ Add debug path flag to GameState
            ✔ Debug shows path of NPCs
    GameState:
        ✔ Move turn and tick info into GameState @done(18-04-12 18:26)
        Entities not in current area should be moved:
            ☐ Could be held in GameState instead
            ☐ MapManager could then be loaded with MapInfo
    Map/Generator Improvement:
        ✔ Create Areas from map with size
        ✔ Pass Area ID into generator
        ✔ Use Area ID when creating Entity
        ☐ Remove the use of getArea
        ☐ Set Player from Generator
    Bugs:
        ☐ Can consume non-consumable items in Equipment Window
        ☐ Picking up equipment doesn't remove it from map

Backlog:
    Animals:
        Food:
            ☐ Food grows on grass tiles
            ☐ Food regrows after a while
        Behaviour:
            Food Seeking:
                ☐ Animals seek out food
                ☐ Eat food when they find it
            Predators:
                ☐ See predators
                ☐ Run away from them
    Cleanup:
        ☐ Make Event Manager part of GameState
        ☐ Remove GameEngine dependency from EntityManager
        Debug Class in GameState:
            This should not be saveable, but needs to be set from the Lua console
            ✔ Debug class
            ✔ Show NPC paths
            ☐ Turn of FoW
            ✔ Add Lua bindings
        Lua Enhancements:
            Redirect print to the Debug Console:
                ☐ print stores output into a table
                ☐ Table is dumped after each command is run
    Improved Loading/Saving:
        Windows:
            Save As Window:
                ☐ Typing and backspace
                ☐ Calls save on GameState
                ☐ Hook into escape window
            Load Window:
                ☐ List all save games
                ☐ Selecting one calls load on GameState
                ☐ Hook into main window
        Process:
            Loading:
                ☐ Load all areas
                ☐ Load all entities
                ☐ Load all components
            Saving:
                ☐ Save all areas
                ☐ Save all entities
                ☐ Save all components
    Make NPCs smarter:
        ☐ Allow NPCs to traverse levels
